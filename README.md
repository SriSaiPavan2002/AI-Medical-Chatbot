# 🧠 **AI-Medical-Chatbot**

**An AI-powered chatbot built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide preliminary medical guidance based on user-described symptoms. This project demonstrates how conversational AI can assist users in understanding their health conditions through interactive, data-driven responses.**

---

## 📌 **Features**

- 💬 Accepts free-form symptom input via command line.
- 🩺 Suggests possible conditions or advice based on trained data.
- 📊 Built using real-world-like patient-doctor dialogue data.
- 🤖 Machine learning and NLP for intelligent responses.
